\section{Conclusions}
summarize the report and suggest future work to further improve the performance of your receiver

A current reuse VCO structure is proposed to provide the LO frequency of 400 MHz. Only 0.2 mW power is consumed. A tunable frequency range of 6 MHz is achieved. 

To further improve the VCO performance, two single-ended half-circuit oscillators can be combined into one differential circuit. Theoretically, this structure will offer larger tunable frequency range while consume nearly the same power.
