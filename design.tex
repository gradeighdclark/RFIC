\section{Circuit Design}
include three sub-sections: one for LNA, one for Mixer and one for VCO. For each subsection discuss the design procedure (describe the circuit architecture, provide justification, and describe your approach for determining the size of transistors and the values of passive elements), include transistor-level schematic, simulation results, and a table summarizing the performance metrics of the circuit.

\subsection{Low Noise Amplifier}

\subsection{Mixer}

\subsection{Voltage Controlled Ocsillator}
