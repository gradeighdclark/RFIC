In this paper, we present the design of a high gain, low power, and low noise front-end Medical Device Radiocommunications Service (MedRadio) receiver for wireless medical technology applications. We employ a low-IF architecture operating at 400 MHz using 0.18 um CMOS technology from the IBM7RF library. Cumulatively, we present individual designs for a low noise amplifier (LNA), a mixer, and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) that have been tuned to minimize power while matching to one another's design constraints. The receiver achieves 36 dB gain with a 3.65 dB noise figure and 1.8 mW of power consumption.
