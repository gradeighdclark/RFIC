\subsection{Voltage Controlled Oscillator}
Fig.2 shows the simulated output transients of the proposed VCO; the VCO provides two differential outputs with the same peak-peak value of 305 mV. The oscillation frequency can also be calculated from the period of sinusoidal waveform, which is 400 MHz. The phase noise is shown in Fig.3 and it is -119 dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset from the center frequency of 400 MHz. Fig.4 plots the simulated tuning curve by varying the controllable voltage. As the tuning voltage sweeps from -0.5 V to 1 V, the oscillation frequency changes from 393 MHz to 400 MHz, indicating a tunable range of 6 MHz. The VCOâ€™s power consumption, which is a critical consideration in Medradio application, is 0.2 mW.
